# OpenOptions

OpenOptions is a simple project that has implementations of the black scholes options model for calculating option prices, option greeks, and option implied volatilities. Initial implementations are in C++ and Python. If you'd like to add an implementation in another language, just submit a pull request!

We hope this is helpful.
